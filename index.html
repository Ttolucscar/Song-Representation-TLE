          Can't the future just wait?<br />
          Can't the deadlines come fashionably late?<br />
          I could push every goal back<br />
          Take control back<br />
          <br />
          If they'd roll back the rate<br />
          At which time starts to fly<br />
          Never landing or standing by<br />
          Never taking a break<br />
          Ever making me retry<br />
          We "nickel-and-dime" every "quarter to two"<br />
          But maybe it's time to let time pass through<br />
          <br />
          If the future is bright<br />
          It doesn't shine with that "end of the tunnel" light<br />
          More like a deer in the headlights<br />
          Sudden red lights<br />
          Or "you're dead" lights<br />
          As the anglerfish bite<br />
          <br />
          It's not fair<br />
          The past is clear but it's clear back there<br />
          What's ahead? No one knows<br />
          But it's closing in, we swear<br />
          Still not in my prime, I have so much to do<br />
          But maybe it's time to let time pass through<br />
          <br />
          I can't just rewrite decisions when life gets strange<br />
          Should I go with my gut on which door I should shut?<br />
          I'm unsure<br />
          I'd keep exploring this rut<br />
          But what good is time without change?<br />
          <br />
          Move on<br />
          'Cause things never last<br />
          Just move on<br />
          'Cause it goes too fast and the past has passed<br />
          So move on<br />
          No one likes an ending<br />
          So what's with the attention we keep on giving them?<br />
          <br />
          Why are we still spending so much time<br />
          Dreading our lives instead of living them?<br />
          Why do we try to divert the river<br />
          When the water is what will deliver us where we need to go?<br />
          <br />
          We may never know why<br />
          Time is always in limited supply<br />
          But we'll live to regret it<br />
          If we get it<br />
          And then let it slip by<br />
          It can never rewind<br />
          <br />
          Once you've lost it, it's hard to find<br />
          Take the journey in stride<br />
          When your plans have been sidelined<br />
          Every hourly chime could begin something new<br />
          So maybe it's time to let time pass through<br />
          <br />
          Not passing by, but passing through<br />
          'Til the well runs dry<br />
          Just passing through<br />
